Saved build products (Nov 5, 2026). Expensive intermediate files (walk-forward predictions, joined game tables) are kept in git
under derived/ so they are never rebuilt by accident. See derived/MANIFEST.md for what each file is and how it was built.

  python derived.py WORK            restore every derived/*.gz (and *.json) into WORK/_tmp/ where the scripts expect them
  python derived.py WORK --save     copy every known build product from WORK/_tmp/ into derived/ (gzipped), then update MANIFEST.md by hand

In a script:  import derived; derived.ensure(WORK, ["dk_holdout_2022.csv", ...])   # restores the files if _tmp/ lacks them
